A UPnP MediaServer/MediaRenderer frontend to MPD via PyGUPnP

Features in progress:

1) MPD as a Media Renderer of content that MPD already knows about
2) MPD as a Media Server of content MPD already knows about that only MPD can consume
3) MPD as a Media Renderer of arbitrary UPnP-exposed audio content
4) MPD as a Media Server of its own data to other peers.
