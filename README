A UPnP MediaServer/MediaRenderer frontend to MPD via PyGObject + Gobject Introspection

Features in progress:

1) MPD as a Media Renderer of content that MPD already knows about
2) MPD as a Media Server of content MPD already knows about that only MPD can consume
3) MPD as a Media Renderer of arbitrary UPnP-exposed audio content
4) MPD as a Media Server of its own data to other peers.

Dependencies:
* pygobject >=0.26 (preferably newer or HEAD)
* gobject introspection >=0.6.14 (preferably newer or HEAD)
* GUPnP >=0.15 with introspection support
* GUPnP-AV >= 0.6 with introspection support

Setup:
* Open server.py with a text editor
  - Edit HOST, PORT, MUSIC_PATH variables to point to the host and port
    of your running MPD server.  MUSIC_PATH is necessary if you wish to 
    be able to listen to media from a remote machine on the local MPD server.

* Run MPD-UPnP with "python server.py"
